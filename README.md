# WeatherReport

## Description

    my motivation to build this project was to get a full understand of how side server api's work.  through the activities i thouhgt i had a really good graps of it until we got to the mini project and o was left dumbfounded staring at empty code for a majority of the time.  The reason for building this project was not only for knowing what the weather will be like 5 days from now but also to finally get a good understandings of how side server api's work.  The problems this program solves is making it so you can know the weather of any city for todays date and up to 5 days from now aswell.  The things i learned from this program is how an async function work paired up with await, it really helped with making my code much more proficient  and cleaner, at least in my opinion.  I also learned how to fully and effectevly use the back ticks for variables and converting them into a string which is a big help to my future endevours.  Last thing i learned whilst writing this program is how simply putting mainElement.empty() would stop my function from repeating itself everytime i clicked the search button.
